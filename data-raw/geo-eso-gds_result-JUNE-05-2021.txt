(Submitter supplied) 1) Background: TP53 gene mutations occur in 70% of oesophageal adenocarcinomas (OACs). Given the central role of p53 in controlling cellular response to therapy we investigated the role of mutant (mut-) p53 and SLC7A11 in a CRISPR-mediated JH-EsoAd1 TP53 knockout model. (2) Methods: Response to 2 Gy irradiation, cisplatin, 5-FU, 4-hydroxytamoxifen and endoxifen was assessed, followed by a TaqMan OpenArray qPCR screening for differences in miRNA expression. more...

2. In-depth clinical and biological exploration of DNA Damage Immune Response (DDIR) as a biomarker for oxaliplatin use in colorectal cancer
(Submitter supplied) Purpose: The DNA Damage Immune Response (DDIR) assay was developed in breast cancer (BC) based on biology associated with deficiencies in homologous recombination and Fanconi Anemia (HR/FA) pathways. A positive DDIR call identifies patients likely to respond to platinum-based chemotherapies in breast and oesophageal cancers. In colorectal cancer (CRC) there is currently no biomarker to predict response to oxaliplatin. more...

23. MiR-193b promotes autophagy and non-apoptotic cell death in oesophageal cancer cells
(Submitter supplied) Background: Successful treatment of oesophageal cancer is hampered by recurrent drug resistant disease. We have previously demonstrated the importance of apoptosis and autophagy for the recovery of oesophageal cancer cells following drug treatment. When apoptosis (with autophagy) is induced, these cells are chemosensitive and will not recover following chemotherapy treatment. In contrast, when cancer cells exhibit only autophagy and limited Type II cell death, they are chemoresistant and recover following drug withdrawal. more...
